# Interview Questions – Java Task 1

## 1. What is the role of JVM, JRE, and JDK?
- JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode.
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides libraries and JVM to run Java programs.
- JDK (Java Development Kit): Provides tools to develop Java applications including compiler.
## 2. Why is main() static in Java?
The main method is static so that the JVM can call it without creating an object of the class.

## 3. Difference between compilation and execution?
- Compilation converts source code (.java) into bytecode (.class).
- Execution runs the bytecode using JVM.

## 4. What is bytecode?
Bytecode is the intermediate compiled code generated by the Java compiler that is executed by JVM.

## 5. How does Java achieve platform independence?
Java achieves platform independence by compiling code into bytecode which can run on any system with JVM.
